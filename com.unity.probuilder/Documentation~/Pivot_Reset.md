# ![Freeze Transform icon](images/icons/Pivot_Reset.png) Freeze Transform

Sets the selected object's position, rotation, and scale to world-relative origin (**{0,0,0}**) without changing any vertex positions. That is, this resets the pivot location and clears all transform values but doesn't change the size, shape, or location of the object in the Scene.
