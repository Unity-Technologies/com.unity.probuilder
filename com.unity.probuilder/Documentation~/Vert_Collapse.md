> ***Tip:*** You can also use this tool with the **Alt+C** (Windows) or **Opt+C** (Mac) hotkey.

ProBuilder uses the **Collapse To First** option to decide whether the vertices are collapsed to a central point, or to the first selected vertex.



## Collapse Vertices Options

![Collapse Vertices options](images/Vert_Collapse_props.png)

The **Collapse Vertices** tool determines where to locate the collapsed vertex in this way:

- If **Collapse To First** option is enabled, ProBuilder uses the location of the vertex that you selected first.
- Otherwise, ProBuilder calculates the center position between all selected vertices to use as the new location.

By default, the **Collapse To First** option is disabled, so ProBuilder uses the center position as in the example image above.
