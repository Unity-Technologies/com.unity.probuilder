# ![Lightmap UVs icon](images/icons/Object_LightmapUVs.png) Lightmap UVs

Manually generates any missing lightmap UVs. This works on each Mesh in every open Scene that is missing lightmap UVs. 

> ***Tip:*** You can edit lightmap generation parameters for specific objects in the [ProBuilderMesh](ProBuilderMesh.md) component found on ProBuilder objects. You can also modify the defaults on the [ProBuilder Preferences](preferences.md#autouvs) window.

There is one option for this tool which you can access like any other [toolbar option](overview-ui.md#pb_options). You can also access it using the menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Editors** > **Open Lightmap UV Editor**), since it appears on the [Lightmap UV Editor](lightmap-uv.md) window.
