Use the **Select Smoothing Group** tool inside the [Smooth Group Editor window](smoothing-groups.md) to select faces matching the current smoothing group. 

To use this tool: 

1. Open the **Smooth Group Editor** window. 

2. Click any face with a smoothing group defined. 

	> ***Note:*** The tool doesn't shrink the current selection, so it's best to start with as small a selection as possible.

> ***Tip:*** You can also access this tool from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Smoothing Group**).
