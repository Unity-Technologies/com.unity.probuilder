# ![Select Hole icon](images/icons/Selection_SelectHole.png) Select Holes

Selects all elements along the selected open vertex or edge. A *hole* is like a removed face. Using this tool is a shortcut for selecting all the edges around the missing face. 

If no elements are selected, this tool automatically selects *all* holes in the selected object.

This tool also tells you how many holes exist in the Mesh. It is available only in the [vertex and edge modes](modes.md).

> ***Tip:*** You can also access this tool from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Hole**).
