# ![Conform Normals Icon](images/icons/Face_ConformNormals.png) Conform Normals (Faces)

Sets all normals on the selected face(s) to the same relative direction.  

ProBuilder uses the direction that most of the *selected* faces on the object are already facing.

In this example, all three selected faces on this cube end up pointing away from the Camera, as you can see from the transform gizmo. This is because two out of three of the selected faces are pointing in the opposite direction, even though the majority of the normals are pointing towards the camera.
