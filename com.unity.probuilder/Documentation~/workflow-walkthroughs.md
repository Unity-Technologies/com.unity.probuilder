# Level walkthroughs

Perform a walkthrough of your level frequently while you build it. This allows you to decide whether the rooms are an appropriate size for your character. If not, go back and edit your buildings or start again.

For example, you should enter Play mode as soon as you put up the basic walls and ceiling and then walk around in your level. By putting yourself in your character's skin, you will make a better game because you know what it feels like to play.

ProBuilder offers many ways to do similar tasks: it is up to you to decide how you like to work. For example, you can either build structures from shapes like they are building blocks or you can make really big cubes, reverse the normals and treat the inner space as the room inside:
