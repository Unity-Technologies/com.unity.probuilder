## Fill Hole Options

![Fill Hole options](images/FillHole_props.png)

Enable the __Fill Entire Hole__ option to fill the entire Mesh opening. This is the default.

If you disable this option, ProBuilder tries to build a Mesh between the selected open vertices. For example, if you have a missing quad, you can select any three adjacent vertices in order to create a triangular polygon that covers half of the hole.
