# Cylinder
A cylinder is a shape with long straight sides and two circular (or roughly circular) ends, like a tube. They have a radius and a height.

You can customize the shape of a cylinder with these shape properties:

| **Property:** | **Description:** |
|:-- |:-- |
| __Radius__ | Set the radius (width) of the cylinder in meters. The default value is 0.5. The minimum value is 0.01. |
| __Number of Sides__ | Set the number of sides for the cylinder. The more sides you use (relative to the size of the __Radius__), the smoother the sides of the cylinder become. The default value is 8. Valid values range from 4 to 48. |
| __Height__ | Set the height of the cylinder in meters. The default value is 1. |
| __Height Segments__ | Set the number of divisions to use for the height of the cylinder. For example, a value of 3 produces 4 faces on every side of the cylinder. The default value is 0. Valid values range from 0 to 48. |
| __Smooth__ | Enable this option to smooth the edges of the polygons. This is enabled by default. |
