# ![Center Pivot icon](images/icons/CenterPivot.png) Center Pivot

Moves the pivot point for the Mesh to the center of the objectâ€™s bounds. For example, if you move a lot of vertices on one side of your Mesh, when you try to rotate the object, it rotates around a point outside of the Mesh.

> ***Note:*** If you have multiple objects selected, each object's new pivot point becomes the center of each object, regardless of the position of any other object.
