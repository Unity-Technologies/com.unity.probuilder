# ![Flip Triangles icon](images/icons/Face_FlipTri.png) Flip Face Edge

Swaps the triangle orientation on the selected face(s) with four sides. This reverses the direction of the middle edge in a quad.

![Edge intersects top-left to bottom right on side of cube before; bottom-left to top-right after flip](images/FlipTri_Example.png)

Use this to smooth ridges in quads with varied height corners.

> ***Note:*** This only works on quads.

This tool is often called **Turn Edges** in other 3D modeling applications
