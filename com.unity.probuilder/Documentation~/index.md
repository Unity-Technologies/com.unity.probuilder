# About ProBuilder

You can build, edit, and texture custom geometry in Unity using the tools available in the ProBuilder package. You can also use ProBuilder to help with in-scene level design, prototyping, collision Meshes, and play-testing on the fly. 

ProBuilder also comes with a [Scripting API](api.md) that allows you to write C# scripts to make your own tools and customizations.

Some of the advanced features include:

* [UV editing and Texture mapping](workflow-texture-mapping.md)
* [Applying Vertex Colors](workflow-vertexcolors.md)
* [Creating parametric shapes](workflow-create.md)

In addition, the ProBuilder package includes a [Model export feature](workflow-exporting.md) which you can use to tweak your levels in any 3D modeling software.
