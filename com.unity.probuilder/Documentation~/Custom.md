# Custom
You can define your own custom Mesh by specifying a set of vertices in the __Custom Geometry__ field: 

    // Vertical Plane
    0, 0, 0
    1, 0, 0
    0, 1, 0
    1, 1, 0

The order to specify vertices is to follow a backwards Z pattern for each face:

Repeat for each adjacent face until you have finished creating the shape you want.
