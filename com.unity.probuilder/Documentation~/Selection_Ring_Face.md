# ![Select Face Ring icon](images/icons/Selection_Ring_Face.png) Select Face Ring

Selects a face ring from each selected face. 

Faces are only considered to be part of a ring if they are quads (contain exactly four sides). Face rings generally run along the X-axis, whereas [face loops](Selection_Loop_Face.md) generally run along the Z-axis.
