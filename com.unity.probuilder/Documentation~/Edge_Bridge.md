# ![Bridge Edges icon](images/icons/Edge_Bridge.png) Bridge Edges

The __Bridge Edges__ tool creates a new face between two selected edges. 

By default, this tool can only bridge two open edges (that is, no face on the *open* or *free* side). However, you can override this; to do so, navigate to the Preferences and enable [Allow non-manifold actions](preferences.md#bridge).

> **Tip:** You can also use this tool with the **Alt/Opt+B** hotkey.
