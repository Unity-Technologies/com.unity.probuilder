# Tool options overlays

You can change settings for some ProBuilder options like extrude, collapse, and grow selection. The settings are available in the **Tool Options Overlay** for each tool. 

The **Tool Options Overlay** opens when you select a tool; if it doesn't, you can open it from the **Overlay Menu**:

1. Select a tool, for example **Main Menu** > **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Grow Selection**.
1. From the **Overlay Menu** overlay, select the corresponding action's button. For example, for the Grow Selection action, the button is **GS**.
1. The **Tool Options Overlay** opens with the current tool's settings.
