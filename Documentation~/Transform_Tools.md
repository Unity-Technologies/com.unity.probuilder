# Transform tools in ProBuilder

Most of the time, you interact with ProBuilder with translation, rotation, and scaling tools in much the same way that you interact with all other GameObject types. However, ProBuilder uses a combination of [Edit modes](modes.md) and special [key combinations](hotkeys.md) to interact with portions of your mesh, such as individual faces. This allows you to manipulate your mesh in ways that aren't possible with standard GameObjects and build complex meshes.

For example, you can use the **Shift** key with the scaling and translation tools in [Face mode](modes.md) to create [insets](Face_Inset.md) and [extrusions](Face_Extrude.md). 

For an overview of working with ProBuilder, refer to [Create meshes](workflow-create.md), [Edit meshes](workflow-edit.md), and [Add materials, colors, and textures](workflow-texture-mapping.md).
