# Store meshes as assets

By default, ProBuilder stores its meshes in the Scene asset, so you can't access them as individual assets. If you need to access the meshes, for example to share them with other projects, you can store them as standalone assets in the Project folder.

To change the saving method ProBuilder uses:

1. Go to **Unity** > **Settings** > **ProBuilder**.
1. Select **Experimental Features Enabled**.
1. Select **Store Mesh as Asset**.

> **Note:** This is an experimental feature.
