# Store meshes as assets

By default, the Unity Editor saves ProBuilder meshes as part of the scene file. This behavior can make it difficult to share meshes between scenes or projects. The **Store Meshes as Assets** feature lets you save ProBuilder meshes as separate assets in the project folder.

To store ProBuilder meshes as assets:

1. In the main menu, go to **Unity** > **Settings** > **ProBuilder**.
1. Enable **Store Meshes as Assets**.
