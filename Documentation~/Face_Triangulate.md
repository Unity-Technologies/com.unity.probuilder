# ![Triangulate Faces icon](images/icons/Face_Triangulate.png) Triangulate Faces

The __Triangulate Faces__ action reduces selected faces to their base triangles. This creates a faceted, non-smooth appearance. 

From the main menu, select **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Geometry** > **Triangulate**.
