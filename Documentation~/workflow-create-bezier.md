# Bezier Shape tool

The Bezier Shape tool uses a Bezier spline (curve) and extrudes along it to create a 3D version of the curve. You fine-tune the shape by using the tangent handles on the control points to bend the shape.

To define a Mesh based on a bezier (curve) shape:

1. [Enable experimental features](preferences.md#experimental).
1. From the main menu, select **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Editors** > **New Bezier Shape**.

	The initial curve has two control points with tangent handles to control the curve's bend. By default, ProBuilder creates the curve [in editing mode](bezier.md) so you can continue to reshape it.
