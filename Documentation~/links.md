ProBuilder follows many of the same conventions as other 3D modeling software, so if you are an experienced 3D artist, you can read the [ProBuilder toolbar](toolbar.md) section and begin using the ProBuilder tools right away.

If you are new to 3D modeling, ProBuilder is a great way to learn. You can watch the tutorial videos on the Unity [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrJfHfcFkLM8PDioWg_5nmUqQycnVmi58) to get started.

<span style="color:red">@TODO: Follow up with Gabriel: the **Tutorials and documentation**Â link opens the documentation only. The **Youtube playlist** link opens Gabriel's old Procore video channel, which hasn't had new videos in years. It would be great to create a new ProBuilder YouTube channel where we could promote the most recent videos.</span>
