# Lightmap UVs

Use the __Lightmap UVs__ action to manually generate any missing lightmap UVs. This works on each Mesh in every open scene that is missing lightmap UVs.

> **Tip:** You can edit lightmap generation parameters for specific objects in the [ProBuilderMesh](ProBuilderMesh.md) component on ProBuilder objects. You can also modify the defaults on the [ProBuilder Preferences](preferences.md#autouvs) window.
