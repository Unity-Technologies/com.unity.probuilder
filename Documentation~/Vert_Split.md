# ![Split Vertices icon](images/icons/Vert_Split.png) Split Vertices

The __Split Vertices__ action splits a vertex into individual vertices (one for each adjacent face) so that you can move the faces independently.

> **Note:** When a vertex splits, the newly separated vertices remain in place. This image only shows the vertices apart as a demonstration, to illustrate that the original vertex became four.

> **Tip:** You can also use this action with the **Alt/Opt+X** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Geometry** > **Split Vertices**).
