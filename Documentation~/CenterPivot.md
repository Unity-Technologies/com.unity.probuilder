# ![Center Pivot icon](images/icons/CenterPivot.png) Center Pivot

The __Center Pivot__ action moves the pivot point for the Mesh to the center of the objectâ€™s bounds. For example, if you move a lot of vertices on one side of your Mesh, when you try to rotate the object, it rotates around a point outside of the Mesh. 

> **Tip:** You can also launch this action from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Object** > **Center Pivot**).

> **Note:** If you have multiple objects selected, each object's new pivot point becomes the center of each object, regardless of the position of any other object.
