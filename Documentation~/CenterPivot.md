# Center Pivot

The __Center Pivot__ action moves the pivot point for a mesh to the center of the objectâ€™s bounds. You might want to do this if you have edited a lot of vertices on one side of your mesh, which can move your pivot point outside of the mesh.

To center the pivot point:

1. [working context: gameobject] 
from the main menu, select **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Object** > **Center Pivot**.

> **Note:** If you have multiple objects selected, each object's new pivot point is the center of that object, regardless of the position of any other object. 

You can also set the pivot to the center of selected edges, faces, and vertices. Refer to the [Set Pivot](SetPivot.md) action for more information.
