# Center Pivot

The __Center Pivot__ action moves the pivot point for a mesh to the center of the objectâ€™s bounds. You might want to do this if you have elongated the vertices on one side of your mesh, which pushes the bounds on that side far from the original center.

To center the pivot point:

1. Select one or more objects.
    > **Note:** If you have multiple objects selected, each object's new pivot point is the center of that object, regardless of the position of any other object. 
1. From the main menu, select **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Object** > **Center Pivot**.

You can also set the pivot to the center of selected edges, faces, and vertices. Refer to the [Set Pivot](SetPivot.md) action for more information.
