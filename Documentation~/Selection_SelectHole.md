# ![Select Hole icon](images/icons/Selection_SelectHole.png) Select Holes

The __Select Holes__ tool selects all elements along the selected open vertex or edge. A *hole* is like a removed face. This tool is a useful shortcut for selecting all the edges around a missing face. 

If you have no elements selected, this tool automatically selects *all* holes in the selected object.

This tool also tells you how many holes exist in the Mesh. It is only available in the [vertex and edge modes](modes.md).

> **Tip:** You can also access this tool from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Hole**).
