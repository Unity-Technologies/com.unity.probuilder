# ![Freeze Transform icon](images/icons/Freeze_Transform.png) Freeze Transform

The __Freeze Transform__ action sets the selected object's position, rotation, and scale to world-relative origin (**{0,0,0}**) without changing any vertex positions. That means it resets the pivot location and clears all Transform values, but doesn't change the size, shape, or location of the object in the Scene.

> **Tip:** You can also launch this action from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Object** > **Freeze Transform**).
