# Connect Edges

The __Connect Edges__ action inserts an edge that connects the centers of each selected edge.

You can use this action with the **Alt/Opt+E** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Smart Connect**).

If you select more than two edges, ProBuilder creates as many new edges as possible without creating bad geometry.

You can connect across several faces, as long as they share a selected edge.
