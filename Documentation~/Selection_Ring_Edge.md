# ![Select Edge Ring icon](images/icons/Selection_Ring.png) Select Edge Ring

The __Select Edge Ring__ action selects a ring from each selected edge. An edge ring is a series of edges which share faces but are not directly connected.

> **Note:** This action only works on quads (four-sided polygons), and is only available in [edge mode](modes.md).
