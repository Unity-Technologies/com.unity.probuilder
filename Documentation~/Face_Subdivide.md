# ![Subdivide Face icon](images/icons/Face_Subdivide.png) Subdivide Face

The __Subdivide Face__ action splits each selected face. To do this, it adds a vertex at the center of each edge and connects them in the center.

> **Tip:** You can also use this action with the **Alt/Opt+S** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Geometry** > **Smart Subdivide**).

This allows you to add a lot more detail to your geometry. Alternatively, you can use the [Cut](cut-tool.md) tool to control the exact shape of the new faces.
