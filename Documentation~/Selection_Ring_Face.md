# ![Select Face Ring icon](images/icons/Selection_Ring_Face.png) Select Face Ring

Selects a face ring from each selected face.

ProBuilder only considers faces part of a ring if they are quads (contain exactly four sides). Face rings generally run along the X-axis, whereas [face loops](Selection_Loop_Face.md) generally run along the Z-axis.

This action is available only in [face mode](modes.md).

> **Tip:** You can also use this tool with the **Alt/Opt+R** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Ring**).
