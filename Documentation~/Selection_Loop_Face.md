# ![Select Face Loop icon](images/icons/Selection_Loop_Face.png) Select Face Loop

The __Select Face Loop__ action selects a face loop from each selected face.

ProBuilder only considers faces part of a loop if they are quads (contain exactly four sides). Face loops generally run along the Z-axis, while [face rings](Selection_Ring_Face.md) generally run along the X-axis.

This action is only available in [face mode](modes.md).

> **Tip:** You can also use this action with the **Alt/Opt+L** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Loop**).
