# ![Invert Selection](images/icons/Selection_Invert.png) Invert Selection

The __Invert Selection__ action selects the inverse of the current selection: all unselected elements become selected, while the current selection becomes unselected.

![Invert Selection Example](images/InvertSelection_Example.png)

In this example:
* **Left image**: All tiles except the corners are selected.
* **Right image**: the __Invert Selection__ action changes the selection so that only the corners are selected.

This action is available in the [vertex, edge, and face modes](modes.md).

> **Tip:** You can also use this action with the **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Invert Selection**).
