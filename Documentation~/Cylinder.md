You can customize the shape of a cylinder with these shape-specific properties:


| **Property:** | **Description:** |
|:-- |:-- |
| __Sides Count__ | Set the number of sides for the cylinder. The more sides you use, the smoother the sides of the cylinder become. The default value is 6. Valid values range from 4 to 64. |
| __Height Cuts__ | Set the number of divisions to use for the height of the cylinder. For example, a value of 3 produces 4 faces on every side of the cylinder. The default value is 0. |
| __Smooth__ | Enable this option to smooth the edges of the polygons. This property is enabled by default. |
