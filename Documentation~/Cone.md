You can customize the shape of a cone with this shape-specific property:


| **Property:** | **Description:** |
|:-- |:-- |
| __Sides Count__ | Set the number of sides for the cone. The more sides you use, the smoother the sides of the cone become. The default value is 6. Valid values range from 3 to 64. |
| **Smooth** | Enable this option to smooth the edges of the polygons. This property is enabled by default. |
