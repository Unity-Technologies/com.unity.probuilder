# Experimental features

ProBuilder includes three experimental features:

* [Create and edit Bezier Shapes](workflow-create-bezier.md)
* [Perform Boolean operations](boolean.md)
* [Store meshes as assets](meshes-as-assets.md)

These features are still under development; they're not fully tested, and might reduce ProBuilder's stability. They are disabled by default; use them with caution.

To enable experimental features, in the main menu, go to **Unity** > **Settings** > **ProBuilder** and enable **Experimental Features Enabled**.
