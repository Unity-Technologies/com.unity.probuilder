# Object options reference

This table lists all the object options you can use with a ProBuilder object. These options always apply to the entire GameObject, so they're available in the GameObject context and all edit modes. 
<!--at least that's what it looks like - they're available from the menu at all times, except the ProBuilderize action-->

These actions are available:

* From the **main menu** > **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Object**.
* From the context menu: 
    1. In the **Tools** overlay, set the working context to ProBuilder. 
    1. In the **Tool Settings** overlay, select an edit mode.
    1. In the **Scene** view, right-click on a ProBuilder object.
