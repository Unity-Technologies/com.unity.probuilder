# ![Select By Smoothing Group action](images/icons/Selection_SelectBySmoothingGroup.png) Select Smoothing Group

Use the **Select Smoothing Group** action inside the [Smooth Group Editor window](smoothing-groups.md) to select faces matching the current smoothing group.

To use this action:

1. Open the **Smooth Group Editor** window.

2. Click any face with a smoothing group defined.

	> **Note:** The action doesn't shrink the current selection, so it's best to start with as small a selection as possible.

3. Click the ![Select By Smoothing Group action](images/icons/Selection_SelectBySmoothingGroup.png) Select Smoothing Group button.

> **Tip:** You can also access this action from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Smoothing Group**).
