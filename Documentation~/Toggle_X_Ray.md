# Toggle X Ray 

[[From the what's new page: * Added a new [Selection X-Ray](preferences.md#sel-xray) option to highlight hidden element selections with a muted color. The default shortcut is **Ctrl/Alt+Shift+X** (modifiable in the Shortcuts Manager), and you can also access it through the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Interaction** > **Toggle X Ray**).]]
