The __Subdivide Object__ action divides every face on selected objects, allowing for greater levels of detail when modeling.

![Subdivide Object Example](images/SubdivideObject_Example.png)

To do this, for each face, it adds a vertex at the center of each edge and connects them in the center of the face.

> **Tip**: You can also launch this action from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Object** > **Subdivide Object**).
