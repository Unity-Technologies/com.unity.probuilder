# Rect

Use the __Rect__ action to choose whether drag selection should only select elements completely inside the drag rectangle, or also elements that are partially inside the the drag rectangle.

![Same drag action has different effect depending on Rect setting](images/DragRect_Example.png)

From the main menu, select **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Interaction** > **Toggle Drag Rect Mode**.

This action is available only in the [edge and face modes](modes.md).


## Visual cues

The button displays the following to indicate what state the action is in:

| **Icon mode:**                                        | **Text mode:**       | **Description:**                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Complete](images/icons/Selection_Rect_Complete.png)   | **Rect: Complete**  | Only select elements that are contained entirely within the drag rectangle. |
| ![Intersect](images/icons/Selection_Rect_Intersect.png) | **Rect: Intersect** | Select elements that are entirely or partially inside the drag-rectangle. |
