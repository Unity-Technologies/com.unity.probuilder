# ![Flip Triangles icon](images/icons/Face_FlipTri.png) Flip Face Edge

The __Flip Face Edge__ action swaps the triangle orientation on the selected face(s) with four sides. This reverses the direction of the middle edge in a quad.

![Edge intersects top-left to bottom right on side of cube before; bottom-left to top-right after flip](images/FlipTri_Example.png)

Use this to smooth ridges in quads with varied height corners.

> **Note:** This only works on quads (four-sided polygons).

This action is often called **Turn Edges** in other 3D modeling applications.

<!-- Formerly called **Flip Triangles**; also called **Turn Edges** in other DCCs) -->

> **Tip:** You can also launch this action from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Geometry** > **Flip Face Edge**).
