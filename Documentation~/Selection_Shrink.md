# ![Shrink Selection](images/icons/Selection_Shrink.png) Shrink Selection

The __Shrink Selection__ action removes the elements on the perimeter of the current selection. It performs the opposite action of the [Grow Selection](Selection_Grow.md) action.

![Shrink Selection Example](images/ShrinkSelection_Example.png)

In this example:
* **Left image**: Five faces are selected.
* **Right image**: The __Shrink Selection__ reduces the selection down to just the central square.

This action is available in the [vertex, edge, and face modes](modes.md).

> **Tip:** You can also use this action with the **Alt/Opt+Shift+G** shortcut, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Shrink Selection**).
