To install this package:

1. Open the Package Manager (in Unity's top menu: **Window** > **Package Manager**).

2. Enter **ProBuilder** in the search box.

3. Click **ProBuilder** in the package list (left side), then click the **Install** button in the package details (right side).

4. To verify that ProBuilder is correctly installed, open the ProBuilder toolbar (from Unity's top menu: **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **ProBuilder Window**).

  If you don't see the **ProBuilder Window** menu item, then ProBuilder did not install correctly.
